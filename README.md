This is a library to make it easier to launch tensor2tensor training jobs on Kubeflow.

NOTE: In the long-term, a library like [Faring](https://github.com/wbuchwalter/fairing) will probably serve your needs so check it out and maybe file feature requests.

# Issues:

1. Currently does not work with most recent version of TFJob operator, last tested with v0.1.2
